2. **Functionality Test**: New feature works as specified
3. **Regression Test**: Previous features still work correctly
4. **Device Test**: Verify on both iPhone and iPad

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Swift coding conventions
- Use SwiftUI best practices
- Maintain MVVM architecture
- Add inline documentation for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branch for each task
- Commit working code after each subtask
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Merge to main only after task completion and testing
