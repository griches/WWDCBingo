### Key Components

#### Game State Management
The `GameViewModel` serves as the central coordinator, managing game state through SwiftUI's reactive binding system. It orchestrates tile selection, pattern detection, and victory celebrations while maintaining clean separation between business logic and user interface.

#### Pattern Detection Algorithm
The `PatternDetector` implements efficient algorithms for recognizing winning patterns:
- **Horizontal**: 5 rows × 5 positions each
- **Vertical**: 5 columns × 5 positions each  
- **Diagonal**: 2 diagonal lines, top left to bottom right, and bottom left to top right

#### Smart Randomization
The `TermsDatabase` implements sophisticated randomization ensuring the center tile (position 2,2) always contains "GOOD MORNEENG" while the remaining 24 positions receive randomly shuffled terms from the complete phrase collection.
