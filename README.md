## What is NSLondon DubDub 25?

NSLondon DubDub 25 is a native iOS app that transforms watching Apple keynotes into an interactive gaming experience. Players receive a randomized 5√ó5 bingo grid filled with classic Apple presentation moments, phrases, and events. As these moments occur during the live presentation, players tap the corresponding tiles. The app automatically detects winning patterns and celebrates with delightful confetti animations.

### Key Components

#### Game State Management
The `GameViewModel` serves as the central coordinator, managing game state through SwiftUI's reactive binding system. It orchestrates tile selection, pattern detection, and victory celebrations while maintaining clean separation between business logic and user interface.

#### Pattern Detection Algorithm
The `PatternDetector` implements efficient algorithms for recognizing winning patterns:
- **Horizontal**: 5 rows √ó 5 positions each
- **Vertical**: 5 columns √ó 5 positions each  
- **Diagonal**: 2 diagonal lines (main and anti-diagonal)

#### Smart Randomization
The `TermsDatabase` implements sophisticated randomization ensuring the center tile (position 2,2) always contains "GOOD MORNEENG" while the remaining 24 positions receive randomly shuffled terms from the complete phrase collection.
