## Overview

The WWDC 2025 Bingo iOS app is a native Swift/SwiftUI application that provides an interactive bingo experience during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote presentations. Users receive a randomized 5x5 bingo grid populated with WWDC-specific phrases and moments, tap tiles as events occur during the presentation, and receive celebratory feedback when achieving bingo patterns.

### Purpose
Transform passive keynote viewing into an engaging, interactive experience through gamification while maintaining focus on the primary content.

## User Interaction Flows

### Primary Flow: Complete Game Session
1. User launches app → Welcome screen displays
2. User taps "Start New Game" → Grid generates with random terms
3. User watches WWDC keynote and taps corresponding tiles
4. App detects bingo pattern → Celebration animation triggers
5. User can continue playing or start new game

### Secondary Flow: Mid-Game Management
1. User accidentally taps tile → Tap again to unmark
2. User backgrounds app → Game state preserved
3. User returns to app → Previous game state restored
4. User wants new game → Reset option available

### Error Handling
- Invalid tile selections handled gracefully
- App state recovery from unexpected termination
- Graceful degradation if animations fail
- Fallback behavior for unsupported device features
