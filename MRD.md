## Product Description

WWDC 2025 Bingo is a native iOS app that transforms the traditional keynote viewing experience into an interactive game. The app features a clean, Apple-inspired interface with a 5x5 bingo grid populated with cleverly curated phrases, moments, and events commonly associated with WWDC presentations.

### Core Concept
Users launch the app before or during the WWDC keynote and receive a randomized bingo card filled with anticipated moments such as "One more thing," "Craig's hair mention," "Xcode for iPad," or "Revolutionary new feature." As these moments occur during the presentation, users tap the corresponding tiles, which become highlighted. The app automatically detects winning patterns and celebrates achievements with delightful animations.

### Value Proposition
- **Enhanced Engagement**: Transforms passive viewing into active participation
- **Community Building**: Creates shared experiences and social media moments
- **Entertainment Value**: Adds humor and anticipation to technical presentations
